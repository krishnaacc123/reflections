How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  ->  It makes easy to find typos or unintentional changes that might be present in newer version but not in older one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  ->  It helps in finding changes made to a file or the previous data of the file for better understanding.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   -> Using auto save creates large no of versions of a file over a period of time.
     But manual commit helps in choosing correct time to save a logical change one at a time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    -> Its because multiple files maybe related to each other and must be looked togeather for possible bug presence like website css and html.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -> Git log is used to see various commits with a message and then "diff" is used to see changes made to code. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    -> Its because it stores different versions of same file so we can find at what particular time and where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    -> I would want to use it for any project.
